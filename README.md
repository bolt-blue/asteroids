# Cross-Platform Window

A simple piece of boilerplate intended to get us a `window` handle regardless
of what platform we're compiling on.

More than just a handle though, **the aim is to provide a surface to draw on**.

If not for direct usage in other projects, it can at least serve as reference.


## Platform Support

We are not targetting every platform in existence, but at least the following:

- [ ] Desktop
    - [ ] Linux
        - [ ] X11
        - [ ] Wayland
    - [ ] OSX
    - [ ] Windows
- [ ] Mobile
    - [ ] Android
    - [ ] iOS
